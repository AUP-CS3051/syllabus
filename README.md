### Course Description
The web applications world is going through many transformations in recent years. Originally conceived as a vehicle for delivering documents, it is now being used as a platform for sophisticated interactive applications, taking the place of traditional desktop ones. Web-based applications offer numerous advantages, such as instant access, automatic upgrades, and opportunities for collaboration on a massive scale. However, creating Web applications requires different approaches than traditional applications and involves the integration of numerous technologies on both the client and the server sides.
In this course we will cover technologies such as HTML, CSS and frameworks, static content generators, JavaScript, AngularJS (ReactJS)  and Node.js.

### Attendance Policy
Attendance is mandatory in all classes and attendance affects the grade. In case of four unexcused absents, a grade of "F" is automatically given.


IN ALL CASES OF MISSED COURSE MEETINGS, THE RESPONSIBILITY FOR
COMMUNICATION WITH THE PROFESSOR, AND FOR ARRANGING TO MAKE UP MISSED
WORK, RESTS SOLELY WITH THE STUDENT.

Whether an absence is excused or not is ALWAYS up to the discretion of
the professor or the department. Unexcused absences can result in a low
or failing participation grade. In the case of excessive absences, it is
up to the professor or the department to decide if the student will
receive an "F" for the course. An instructor may recommend that a
student withdraw, if absences have made it impossible to continue in the
course at a satisfactory level.
Students must be mindful of this policy when making their travel
arrangements, and especially during the Drop/Add and Exam Periods.

### Grading Policy
* 10% midterm
* 20% participation and attendance
* 40% exercises
* 30% project

### Learning Outcome
Students will learn the MEAN stack as well as both server and client side technologies. The design principles
behind them as well as best practices will also bea learned. Students should be able to use the knowledge in order to create sophisticated web applications.
